OddOrEven - Endpoint
CODE: This code tells a user if the integer entered is odd or even.
Peer review by Jessie Lamzon: Code works well and is with assignment requirements. I really like how the code is structured, very clean and simple. Goood job!

Instructions: Run the debug on the code. 
In Postman open a new request window. 
Type in https://localhost:7186/ *This is the port number you obtained after you debugged the C# program. It is found in the debug console. Yours may differ.* 
Then type in oddoreven *This is the name of the controller to target*
Then type in your number.
It should all look similar to this https://localhost:7186/oddoreven/{number}
